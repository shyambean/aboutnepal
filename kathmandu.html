    <h2>Kathmandu</h2>
    <p>Kathmandu, capital of Nepal. It lies in a hilly region near the confluence of the Baghmati and Vishnumati rivers, at an elevation of 4,344 feet (1,324 metres) above sea level. It was founded in 723 by Raja Gunakamadeva. Its early name was Manju-Patan; the present name refers to a wooden temple (kath, “wood”; mandir, “temple” or “edifice”) said to have been built from the wood of a single tree by Raja Lachmina Singh in 1596. A building, supposedly the original, still stands in the central square and is used for the accommodation of sadhus (holy men). Kathmandu served as the seat of the ruling Shah family of the Gurkha people from 1768 to 2008.</p>
